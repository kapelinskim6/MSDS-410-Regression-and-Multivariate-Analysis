#(5 points) How many observations are in the sample data? (Hint: The answer needs to be computed. It is not simply a value listed on this page.)
The number of observations is 72. We use the Corrected Total + 1 to determine the number of observations. The one degree of freedom is used for the intercept parameter.

#(5 points) Write out the null and alternate hypotheses for the t-test for Beta1.
H0 : 𝛽1=0 , H1 : 𝛽1≠0

Model 2: Now let’s consider the following SAS output for an alternate regression model which we will refer to as Model 2.

#(5 points) Now let’s consider Model 1 and Model 2 as a pair of models. Does Model 1 nest Model 2 or does Model 2 nest Model 1? Explain.
The predictor variables in Model 1 are a subset of Model 2. So we can say that Model 1 (reduced model) is nested by model 2 (full model).

#(5 points) Write out the null and alternate hypotheses for a nested F-test using Model 1 and Model 2
H0: 𝛽1=𝛽2=...=𝛽6=0 vs. H1: 𝛽𝑖≠0

#(5 points) Compute the F-statistic for a nested F-test using Model 1 and Model 2.
F0 = [𝑆𝑆𝐸(𝑅𝑀)−𝑆𝑆𝐸(𝐹𝑀)](dim(𝐹𝑀)−dim(𝑅𝑀))𝑆𝑆𝐸(𝐹𝑀)[𝑛−dim(𝐹𝑀)] = F0 = [630.35953−572.60911](7−5)572.60911[72−7] = 3.2777
Here are some additional questions to help you understand other parts of the SAS output.

#(0 points) Compute the AIC values for both Model 1 and Model 2.
AIC = n * ln (RSSn) + 2p
Model 1 = 72 * ln ( 630.3595372) + 2*5 = 166.2129
Model 2 = 72 * ln ( 572.6091172) + 2*7 = 163.2946

#(0 points) Compute the BIC values for both Model 1 and Model 2. (Hint: Compute the BIC using the Schwarz BIC formula. Why does this value differ from the SAS value? What formula does SAS use?)
 BIC = n * ln (RSSn) + p * ln(n)
 Model 1 = 72 * ln ( 630.3595372) + 5 * ln (72) = 177.5962
 Model 2 = 72 * ln ( 572.6091172) + 7 * ln (72) = 179.2313
SAS calculates the BIC using the Sawa calculation for BIC whereas the above values where calculated using the Schwarz SBC formula.

#(0 points) Compute the Mallow’s Cp values for both Model 1 and Model 2. (Hint: This is a trick question. Do these values make sense? Why might they not make sense? Consult your LRA book.)
𝐶𝑝= 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑝 𝑀𝑆𝐸 – n + 2 * p
𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 1= 𝐶𝑝 = 630.359539.40835 -72 + 2 * 5 = 5.0000
𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 2= 𝐶𝑝 = 572.609118.80937 -72 + 2 * 7 = 7.0000

#(0 points) Verify the t-statistics for the remaining coefficients in Model 1.
tintercept = 11.330271.99409 = 5.6819
tx2 = 8.274302.33906 = 3.5374
tx3 = 0.491820.26473 = 1.8578
tx4 = −0.493562.29431 = -0.2151

#(0 points) Verify the Mean Square values for Model 1 and Model 2.
MSE = 𝑆𝑆𝐸𝑑𝑓
 Model 1 =630.3595367 = 9.4083
 Model 2 = 572.6091165= 8.8093

#(0 points) Verify the Root MSE values for Model 1 and Model 2.
RMSE = √𝑀𝑆𝐸
 Model 1 = √9.40835= 3.0673
 Model 2 = √8.80937= 2.9680
